Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighbourhood in London. 

<li>As known, London is considered one of the most visited cities globally.</li>
It has diverse cultures with various races and demographics. In short, London is a mix of everything, and we can write uncountable pages</li>

describing its culture, history and economy. Thus, in this project, I addressed the issue of moving to the city of London</li>
as an ex-pat or as an international student or any other reasons that make you move to London.</li>
I considered criteria like safety and renting cost to list the best boroughs for living, studying and working.  Besides, I addressed the population rate in each borough for further measurement and analysis.</li>
Furthermore, I did not point out the transportation services or the entertainment venues, since London is a well-linked city in those terms. </li>


Business Problem:</li>




 The problem is to precisely find out the best boroughs that possess the two criteria. The experiment covered two years and did not address the kind of crimes and accommodation category in detail. </li>


Targeted Audience:</li>


<li> For everyone who wants to move and live in a megacity in general.</li> 
<li> For tourists and visitors who are looking for general criteria, and for those heading to London shortly.</li>


Data needed:</li>




The needed data are as the following:</li>
<li> List of Boroughs and neighbourhoods of the city of London with their geodata (latitude and longitude) and their population.</li>
<li> List of crimes in Londonâ€™s boroughs with their addresses.</li>
<li> List of boroughs with home renting prices (least cost).</li>


Problems:
<li> Well, in the end, we have to point out some limitations to my study. First of all, the rent prices and crime rates figures are only limited to a short window. Thus, larger data are needed for more accuracy. In addition, it seems that the best boroughs based on the explained criteria are near to the suburbs of the city of London and somehow far from the city centre. It brings backs the dilemma of settling in the centre of mega-cities, which is common globally. Thus, considering the well-designed transportation services in a city like London, living in the suburbs does not seem to be an issue. Besides, more details can be considered for renting costs, like types of accommodation, which can lead to a more accurate study.
