<b>Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighbourhood in London.</b>

As known, London is considered one of the most visited cities globally.
It has diverse cultures with various races and demographics. In short, London is a mix of everything, and we can write uncountable pages
describing its culture, history and economy. Thus, the project addressed the issue of moving to London for work, study or tourism. I considered listing the best boroughs/places to live based on two metrics: safety and renting cost.

<b>Business Problem:</b><br>
The problem is to precisely find out the best boroughs to live in based on the mentioned metrics. However, the experiment covered only two years and did not address the severity of crimes and accommodation category in detail.
Targeted Audience:
It targets everyone who tends to live in a megacity like London and is interested to know general ideas rather than the details.</li>
</br>

<b>Data needed:</b><br>
The needed data are as the following:
<li>List of Boroughs and neighbourhoods of the city of London with their geodata (latitude and longitude) and their population.</li>
<li>List of crimes in Londonâ€™s boroughs with their addresses.</li>
<li>List of boroughs with home renting prices (least cost).</li>
</br>

<b>Problems:</b><br>
All in all, we have to point out some limitations to the study. First, the rent prices and crime rates figures are only limited to a few years. Thus, larger data are needed for better accuracy. In addition, it seems that the best boroughs based on the explained criteria are near to the suburbs areas of London and far from the city centre. It brings back the dilemma of settling in the centre of mega-cities, which is common globally. Thus, considering the well-designed transportation services in a city like London, living in the suburbs does not seem to be an issue. Besides, more details can be considered for renting costs, like types of accommodation, which can lead to a more accurate study.</li>
