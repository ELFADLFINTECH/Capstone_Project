Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods

<li>As known, London is considered one of the most important, expensive and visited city in the globe.</li>
It has diverse cultures with various races and demographics. In short, London is a mix of everything and we can write uncountable pages</li>
describing its culture, history and economy. Thus, in this project, I will address the issue of moving to the city of London</li>
as an expat or as an international students or any other reasons that make you move to London. I will consider some criteria in</li>
listing the best boroughs to live or to work or to study based on safety measurment, average renting rate. Besides, I will address</li>
the population rate in each boroughs for further measuremnt and analysis. Once again, my concentration is the safety and the renting</li>
rate.Furthermore, I did not point out about the transportation services or the entertainment venues since, I do belive that London is</li>
a well linked city in terms of transportation services and with that it will be easy to reach entertaining venues through varoius</li>
transportaion services that the city provides to its people and visitors.
